      <h3>What is Delta 8 THC?</h3>

      Delta-8-THC, or delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol, is a naturally occurring
      minor cannabinoid found in the cannabis plant. It is chemically similar to
      delta-9-THC, the primary psychoactive compound in cannabis, but with some
      differences in its molecular structure. Delta-8-THC is considered to be
      less potent than delta-9-THC, but it still has psychoactive effects and
      can produce a mild high. Delta-8-THC is typically found in low
      concentrations in cannabis plants, but it can be extracted and
      concentrated to create products such as oils, edibles, and vape
      cartridges. These products have become increasingly popular in recent
      years, with some people seeking out delta-8-THC for its purported
      therapeutic benefits or as a milder alternative to delta-9-THC. It is
      important to note that the legality of delta-8-THC products can vary
      depending on local laws, and they should only be used under the guidance
      of a healthcare professional.

      <h3>How old do I have to be to shop here?</h3>

      In Indiana, the legal age to purchase or possess tobacco and
      tobacco-related products, including smoking accessories such as pipes and
      rolling papers, is 21 years old. Therefore, one must be at least 21 years
      old to go into a smoke shop in Indiana. This age limit is in accordance
      with the federal law, which raised the minimum age to purchase tobacco
      products to 21 in December 2019. It is important to note that the age
      limit may also apply to the purchase of vaping products, as well as any
      other products that contain nicotine or tobacco.
